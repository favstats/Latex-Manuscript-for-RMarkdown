# Basic Latex Template for RMarkdown

An adaptation of Steven Miller's excellent [RMarkdown manuscript template](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/02/svm-r-markdown-manuscript/) for times when you need to look like a LaTeX user or times when you need the title and abstract on a separate title page. Retains most of the YAML options in Steven Miller's template. 

## Getting Started

Requires RStudio / RMarkdown etc. Find it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Installation
